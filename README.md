## Overview
The Energy Dynamics Dashboard aims to:
Analyze and compare the energy dynamics between least developed and developed countries.
Check the pattern of energy consumption from different sources (fossil fuels, renewables, nuclear, etc.) in both developed and least developed countries.
Visualize the pattern of energy production from various sources across selected countries.
Show the energy intensity level of primary energy in different countries, highlighting energy efficiency relative to economic output.
