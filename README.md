## Overview
The Energy Dynamics Dashboard aims to:
Analyze and compare the energy dynamics between least developed and developed countries.
Check the pattern of energy consumption from different sources (fossil fuels, renewables, nuclear, etc.) in both developed and least developed countries.
Visualize the pattern of energy production from various sources across selected countries.
Show the energy intensity level of primary energy in different countries, highlighting energy efficiency relative to economic output.
## Features
#### Country Selection: 
Compare specific countries or groups (e.g., all LDCs or developed countries) to understand their energy dynamics.
#### Time Series Analysis: 
Visualize trends in energy consumption and production over time.
#### Energy Mix Breakdown: 
Explore the proportion of energy derived from different sources like fossil fuels, renewables, and nuclear energy.
#### Energy Intensity Metrics: 
Compare the energy efficiency of economies by displaying the energy intensity (energy used per unit of GDP) for each country.
#### Interactive Visualizations: 
Users can interact with data through dynamic charts and graphs, drill down into specific data points, and adjust the timeline.
## Visualizations
The dashboard includes several key visualizations to analyze and compare the energy dynamics and economic factors of least developed and developed countries. Below is an explanation of each visual:
Energy Consumption in different countries.
##### Average Energy Production
##### DAX (DATA ANALYSIS EXPRESSIONS)
##### Sum of Energy Intensity level of primary energy by year
##### Energy intensity of countries shown by map
